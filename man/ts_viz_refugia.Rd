\title{Plot proportion of year meeting refugia conditions over time}
\usage{
ts_viz_refugia(
  area = c("monterey_bay", "channel_islands", "fort_bragg", "san_francisco"),
  yr_range = 1990:2100,
  def = "def8",
  input_file = abalone::percentdays,
  persist_thresh = c(50, 95),
  extent_list = abalone::extent_list
)
}
\arguments{
\item{area}{Character. Name of the area; must match a key in \code{abalone::extent_list}.}

\item{yr_range}{Numeric vector. Range of years to include. Default is 1990â€“2100.}

\item{def}{Character. Refugia definition name (e.g., "def8") used in input file paths.}

\item{input_file}{R Object. Dataframe of \% of year stressed. Defaults to \code{abalone::percentdays}}

\item{persist_thresh}{Integer. Value representing the temporal threshold used to define refugia}

\item{extent_list}{List of vectors. Defaults to \code{abalone::extent_list}}
}
\value{
Produces a \code{ggplot2::ggplot} object of an annual time series of refugia.
}
\description{
This function produces a \code{ggplot2} object of an annual time series of refugia
across all ESMs, including the ensemble mean. It tells you the proportion of each
year that refugia condtions were met, based on the temporal threshold used. Note
this function will only work for refugia definitions that are calculated using
\% of year defined as refugia (i.e., not Definitions 1-2).
